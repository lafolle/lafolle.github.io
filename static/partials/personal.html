			"The Roots"

			<p>Sometimes its a race growing up , moving in cars,
			parking in lanes, money coming in , money going out, 
			And then there are some lucky ones successful in finding 
			their roots and putting this metropolitan anxiety to rest ,  
			and breathing a non toxic air. These roots are deeper than  
			your ancestors, great grandfathers , grandfathers and fathers. 
			This is your village, which will probably never turn into a concrete   
			garbage for as long as you are busy living in a furiously growing  
			city. 
			Beri, only 24.5 kms from my hometown , still produces a heavy  
			change of visuals from  city buildings to vast empty spaces of agricultural  
			land and mud-made homes .The quick difference in just half an hour itself is very exciting. Beri is my ancestral land , my Great granfathers and their great history ,  still hangs reposeful  on every wall of the house. There's always a thing about old empty places,  when you open them , the air you breathe takes you to the world war era.

			<p>This life is a goodly thing.
				We walk , we chant, we see
				we ignore.
				But this life is a goodly thing,
				where in every direction you see
				is a sense of life. A life beating
				through a heart or flying carefree
				in the meadows.
				A life sitting all quiet and pensive,
				or a life nurturing another.
				Its not just in me that i feel i exist
				Its everywhere i see, breathing exists.
				And this life seems a goodly thing.
